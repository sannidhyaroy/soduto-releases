    <h1><b>Version 3.0.0</b></h1>

    <div class="caution">
        <h2>⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES</h2>
        <p>
            Support for macOS 10.x and earlier has been dropped.
            [<a href="https://github.com/sannidhyaroy/Soduto/commit/c424476">c424476</a>]<br>
            The minimum supported macOS version is now <strong>macOS 11.0 (Big Sur)</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Soduto is a decade-old project and accumulated a large amount of deprecated and legacy code over time.
            Replacing these components with modern APIs while keeping older macOS versions functional has become
            increasingly difficult and unsustainable. Additionally, macOS 10.x is more than six years old.
            Given Apple’s long software support lifecycle, systems still running these versions are typically very
            outdated, making ongoing maintenance, testing, and stability harder to guarantee.
        </p>

        <p>
            Untangling and replacing these legacy dependencies will require multiple development iterations,
            as Soduto is deeply integrated with deprecated components and legacy Objective-C code,
            due to having seen little active development for nearly a decade.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyone interested in maintaining or extending support for older macOS versions is free to fork the
            project and continue development.
        </p>

    <h3>Known Bugs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The notification payload is usually sent only once by KDE Connect for each notification ID.
            Dismissing a notification and using the <em>Request Notifications</em> option may result in missing
            notification icons. This also affects messaging apps like WhatsApp that reuse notification IDs.
            This is a KDE Connect limitation with no clean workaround currently.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some apps, such as <code>Ghostty</code>, are known to capture keyboard input,
            preventing termination of the <em>Control Remote Device</em> function even after
            pressing <code>Option + Escape</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Workaround</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To forcefully exit <em>Control Remote Device</em>, go to the App Info page of
            KDE/Zorin Connect on your Android device and tap <strong>Force Stop</strong>.
        </li>
    </ul>
