    <title>Soduto Release Notes</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1><b>Version 2.0.2</b></h1>

    <h2>Enhancements:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Auto-check for updates button added in Preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Improvements:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Soduto wouldn't explicitly request for notification permissions, if it wasn't already authorized to push
            notifications in macOS. We've
            fixed this issue in this release.</li>
        <li>There was an issue with Auto-copy OTP from Google Messages to clipboard where Soduto would copy the OTP
            along with the hidden/invisible characters between the OTP digits which resulted in failed OTP validation.
        </li>
        <li>Notification app icons were relocated & reorganized.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Known bugs:</h3>
    <p>
        The <code>Share Extension</code> is a <b>nightly feature</b> and hence <b>buggy</b> & <i>doesn't</i> provide
        support sharing <b><i>multiple files</i></b> yet. Select
        only <b>one</b> file and use the <code>share extension</code>. <code>Soduto Share</code> won't appear in the
        <code>share menu</code> if <b>multiple files</b> are selected.
    </p>
    <h3>WORKAROUND:</h3>
    <p>To share multiple files, use the option to <code>Send Files</code> from the menu bar app options or
        <code>drag & drop</code> multiple selected
        files to the menu bar icon.
    </p>
